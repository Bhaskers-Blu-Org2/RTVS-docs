# RTVS documentation has moved

The R Tools for Visual Studio documentation has moved to https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/rtvs. 

Contributions can be made by clicking the "Edit" command on the upper right of any page, or through the repository at https://github.com/Microsoft/visualstudio-docs/. Also use https://github.com/Microsoft/visualstudio-docs/ for issues.

This branch, `gh-pages`, is no longer used for documentation; the `master` branch, however, still contains the examples for RTVS.
